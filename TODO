- More granularity of builds. Allow rebuilding of individual releases, 
  individual packagesets for a release, and even individual packages.
- Make it possible to install a functional ports tree into releases. 
- Give option of dumping built packages in a directory that is shared via
  http/ftp so it can be used for binary package updates on running systems with 
  portupgrade -P.
- Add paging to bootloader menu so we can have more than 8 or so installation
  types.
- Allow customization of install from bootloader menu: give user option to
  select release, packagesets, disk layout, etc. as an alternative to
  pre-configured installations in farbot configuration file.
- Add an option for per port distfiles which can be copied from some location.
  This way the distfiles cache given by the DistfilesCache option in PackageSets
  can be periodically cleaned out without fear of accidentally deleting some
  distfile that can't be automatically downloaded (e.g. diablo-jdk).
- Somehow save package build options to /var/db/ports/<portname>/option in 
  imaged systems, so that important build options will not be forgotten when 
  the package is later upgraded.
