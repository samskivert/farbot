- Make package builds remove all installed packages and completely clean the
  ports tree (perhaps by rm'ing it then doing portsnap extract) in a chroot
  prior to starting a new build. This will make it more likely that doing
  package builds without doing a release build won't lead to breakage.
- More granularity of builds. Allow rebuilding of individual releases, 
  individual packagesets for a release, and even individual packages.
- Make it possible to install a functional ports tree into releases. 
- Create options to define what to include in a release: minimal system, X,
  ports, sources, kernel source only, etc.
- Give option of dumping built packages in a directory that is shared via
  http/ftp so it can be used for binary package updates on running systems with 
  portupgrade -P.
- Binary patches for base system update. Keep previous versions of a built
  release around, and each time a new build of that release is done, create a
  patch (or set of patches) against the previous version using bsdiff (see
  http://sf.net/projects/cx-bsdiff for python bsdiff module. This needs a port).
  Then, keep these patch(sets), with cryptographic signatures, and make them
  available in some http/ftp accessible dir for older farbot-built machines to
  grab when an update is needed. Bonus points if the client can use
  freebsd-update. Ignore changes in config files! Not sure how to handle the
  kernel; maybe just require local upgrade/recompilation of kernel on clients
  for now.
