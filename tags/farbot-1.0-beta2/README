Farbot: FreeBSD Automated Release Bot

Farbot automates building of netinstall/PXE boot FreeBSD releases. It currently 
handles the following:

* Building FreeBSD releases, including grabbing any source needed. It is also
  possible to just extract a release from a FreeBSD CD ISO if a custom build is
  unnecessary.
* Building packages for each release, derived from per installation package sets.
* Laying out an NFS/TFTP exportable file system structure for all built
  releases, customized for each installation type.
* Generation of a customized bootloader with options to install each
  installation type.

To run farbot, you need a system running FreeBSD with Python 2.4 and the ZConfig 
Python module. To install, just run 

    ./setup.py install

Farbot includes a suite of tests which can be run before installing if desired:

    ./runtest.py
